# aircon_automation
This is a small home automation project to control my old AC via Telegram using a servo motor, DHT11 temperature sensor and a ESP32 micro controller.

# What can you do with it?
The setup of my AC was very special, but feel free to use this template to control anathing via a Telegram chat you can connect to your microcontrollers.
You can create a chat with a personal bot on Telegram. This bot can provide configurable buttons which send messages to the micro controller. It can also read in normal messages if you want to pass in numbers for example and it can also provide responses from the micro controller to inform the User about the current status.

# Prerequisites
* ESP32
* Servo-motor
* DHT11 temperature sensor
* Telegrambot (created with botfather)
* Arduino IDE
